# Changes

## 2.14.0 [2024/03/30] "BSides Tokyo Release"

**New Features:**

- Added `--include-status` option: You can specify rules based on their `status`. (#1193) (@hitenkoku)
- Added a `-s, --low-memory-mode` option that uses up to 95% less memory. However, in order to do this, Hayabusa cannot sort results nor use `-R, --remove-duplicate-data` and/or `-X, --remove-duplicate-detections` in combination.  (#1254) (@hach1yon @hitenkoku)

**Enhancements:**

- Removed unused crates. (@YamatoSecurity)
- JSON input now supports the format exported from Splunk. (#1083) (@hitenkoku)
- Performance enchancements. (#1277, #1278) (@fukusuket)
- Reordered `search` result fields to look similar to the `csv-timeline` command results. (#1297) (@hitenkoku)
- Added master piece character in ascii art eggs. R.I.P. lovely master hidden behind the gas mask. (#1304) (@hitenkoku)

**Bug Fixes:**

- JSON output of the `search` command was missing the `AllFieldInfo` field. (#1251) (@hitenkoku)
- The time the user took to choose options in the scan wizard was included in elapsed time so we now exclude that. (#1291) (@hitenkoku)
- Fixed `-h, --help` option is being displayed multiple times. (#1309) (@hitenkoku)

## 2.13.0 [2024/02/11] "Year Of The Dragon Release"

**Enhancements:**

- Adjusted the `search` command's Filter option to be an exact match and support wildcard characters. (#1240) (@hitenkoku)
- Any time there is a change in a detection rule, it will be displayed when running the `update-rules` command. Previously, only rules that updated their `modified` field would be displayed. (#1243) (@hitenkoku)
- The `json-timeline` command now outputs in JSON format when outputting to the terminal. (#1197) (@hitenkoku)
- Added support for parsing JSON input when the data is inside an array. (#1248) (@hitenkoku)
- Changed the `‖` separator into a `·` separator to make it easier to read and render properly on older terminals. (#1258) (@YamatoSecurity)
- Added a `-h, --help` option to General Options for all commands. (#1255) (@hitenkoku)
- Changed the `Details` output in the `json-timeline` command from alphabetical order to the original order.
- Loading detection rules is now skipped when running commands that do not need them. (#1263) (@hitenkoku)

## 2.12.0 [2023/12/23] "SECCON Christmas Release"

**Enhancements:**

- `%MitreTactics%`, `%MitreTags%`, `%OtherTags%` fields are now outputted as an array of strings in JSON output. (#1230) (@hitenkoku)

- Output messages about reporting issues and false positives when using `csv-timeline` or `json-timeline` commands. (#1236) (@hitenkoku)

**Bug Fixes:**

- In JSON output, multiple field names with the same names were not outputted as an array so only one result would be returned when parsing with `jq`. We fixed this by outputting multiple field data with the same field name inside an array. (#1202) (@hitenkoku)
- Fixed a bug in the `csv-timeline`, `json-timeline`, `eid-metrics`, `logon-summary`, `pivot-keywords-list` and `search` commands so that Hayabusa will quit whenever no input option (`-l`, `-f` or `-d`) is specified. (#1235) (@hitenkoku)

- In the rare case that there is no `Data` field such as for JSON input, a panic would occur. (#1215) (@fukusuket)

## 2.10.0 [2023/10/31] "Halloween Release"

**Enhancements:**

- Added a scan wizard to help new users choose which rules they want to enable. Add the `-w, --no-wizard` option to run Hayabusa in the traditional way. (Scan for all events and alerts, and customize options manually.) (#1188) (@hitenkoku)

**New Features:**

- Certain code numbers are now mapped to human-readable messages based on the `.yaml` config files in `./rules/config/data_mapping`. (Example: `%%2307` will be converted to `ACCOUNT LOCKOUT`). You can turn off this behavior with the `-F, --no-field-data-mapping` option. (#177) (@fukusuket)
- Added the `-R, --remove-duplicate-data` option in the `csv-timeline` command to replace duplicate field data with the string `DUP` in the `%Details%`, `%AllFieldInfo%`, `%ExtraFieldInfo%` columns to reduce file size. (#1056) (@hitenkoku)

- Added `--include-eid` and `--exclude-eid` options to `csv-timeline`, `json-timeline`, and `pivot-keywords-list` commands. The `--include-eid` option only scans the specified EventID(s). `--exclude-eid` excludes them. (#1130) (@hitenkoku)
- Added the `-R, --remove-duplicate-data` option to the `json-timeline` command to replace duplicate field data with the string `DUP` in the `%Details%`, `%AllFieldInfo%`, `%ExtraFieldInfo%` fields to reduce file size. (#1134) (@hitenkoku)
